- I have to consider
    - a word can be used in different ways like an adjective, noun, etc. e.g. "partOfSpeech":"adjective",
    - one meaning object contain definition of this same word in different partOfSpeech
    - different meaning obj contain another meaning of the word
    - thing is i can add a full option in slash command
        - initially it will only show the top meaning

- search word using requests library
